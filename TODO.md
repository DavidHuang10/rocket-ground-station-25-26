NEXT TASK: allow zoom in on graphs. probably add a new endpoint for sending all data for a sepcific column (maybe a lil inefficient but should be fine honestly)
^^ Might want to look at fullscreen in plans.

OTHERS: make graphs rearrangeable on the frontend, or allow some graphs to be hidden with checkbox
